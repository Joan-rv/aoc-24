My solutions for Advent of Code 2024. I started with C and some with C++, and as the problems got harder, switched to python. My own [```libgnl```](https://github.com/Joan-rv/get_next_line) is used in the C/C++ code, so it is necessary to install it.\
To build the C/C++ solutions simply run make:
```sh
make
```
